Agricrafture
============

Agricrafture is a WIP Minecraft mod built using the Forge API and Minecraft Coder Pack. Its purpose is to add more food and farming items to the game, including more crops, machines, trees, a new ore, and possibly mobs.

Currently, Agricrafture is incomplete and nonfunctional, and I am working to fix bugs that are likely related to my relative inexperience with advanced modding.
